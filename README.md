# Spotify Music Data Into S3 Bucket By Using ETL Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built using **Apache Airflow**, which automates the process of extracting data from the **Spotify API**, transforming the data with **Python**, and loading it into an **S3 bucket** for storage. The pipeline is scheduled and managed using **Airflow DAGs**.

## Key Features:
- **Extracts data** from Spotify API, including data such as songs, albums, or playlists.
- **Transforms the data** into the desired format (e.g., CSV or JSON) using custom Python scripts.
- **Loads the transformed data** into an S3 bucket for further analysis or use.
- **Orchestrates the entire ETL workflow** using Apache Airflow for scheduling and automation.
